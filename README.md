Problem Statement

Increase the speed of the player by 1 after every 5 seconds, and the starting speed should always be 5. No matter how many times the game is restarted.

Increment the score only when the rear end (back) of myCar (yellow) has passed the rear end (back) of an enemyCar (green). The score should be incremented by 10 at each passing. Score shouldnâ€™t increment in any other case.
